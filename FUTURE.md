# Shopora 2.0: Frontend Evolution

The goal is to move from a static interface to a dynamic, block-based storefront that rivals modern Shopify themes.

## Phase 1: Merchant Experience (Admin)
- [ ] **Product Manager**: A robust UI for handling multi-variant products and media uploads.
- [ ] **Dashboard 2.0**: Interactive charts for real-time sales and market performance.
- [ ] **Theme Editor**: A visual "drag-and-drop" interface for managing `Page` and `Theme` sections.

## Phase 2: High-Performance Storefront
- [ ] **Headless SDK**: A set of hooks and components to build custom storefronts rapidly.
- [ ] **Predictive Search**: Real-time product discovery as the customer types.
- [ ] **Cart Side-panel**: Seamless user experience for managing additions without page reloads.

## Phase 3: Sections & Blocks Architecture
Inspired by Shopify Online Store 2.0.
- [ ] **JSON Templates**: Defining page layouts via JSON, allowing merchants to reorder sections.
- [ ] **App Blocks**: Allowing third-party widgets to be injected into the storefront via the Theme Editor.
- [ ] **Advanced CSS Tools**: Global style settings for typography, colors, and spacing.

## Phase 4: Localization & Personalization
- [ ] **Market Switcher**: Leveraging the backend `Market` logic to switch language/currency.
- [ ] **Dynamic Checkout**: One-click buy buttons (Apple Pay, Google Pay).
- [ ] **Personalized Recommendations**: Using "Recently Viewed" and "Frequently Bought Together" components.
